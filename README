This is a vim remake of an old macro I had for Multi-Edit, handy it was though
not so necessary with VIM, given A and :s but this will not mess up your cursor
position, works on a range, etc. It has some use.

There are default/example mappings for both visual and normal modes:

For end of line toggling:

<leader>;    toggles ";" at end of line.
<leader>,    toggles "," at end of line.
<leader>:    toggles ":" at end of line.


For start of line: (start of line for this is first non white space char, like
^ as opposed to 0 )

<leader>s,    toggles ", " at start of line.
<leader>s:    toggles ": " at start of line.


NOTE that you can toggle strings not just chars; I.e. ":TSOL --", ":TEOL --"
and so on.
